The .tsv (Tab Separated Values) file was processed and cleaned using the code file named:
'data-cleaning.ipynb'.

After cleaning the data was converted to .csv (Comma Separated Values) file and transferred to RDBMS PostgreSQL server.

For the simplicity and avoid huge file size, a sample dataset named 'appl_1_amazon_pc.csv' has been created to perform Sentimental Analysis of reviews of Product Title 'Fire HD 7, 7" HD Display, Wi-Fi, 8 GB'
